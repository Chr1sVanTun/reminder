While sitting in Home Office in Front of my Computer i got frustrated by the lack of physical activity.
So i wrote a small python script that reminds me of doing 21 Air Sqats followed by 12 push ups.

It will open a Windows MessageBox with the Windows Default Beep sound to remind you.
It also contains a little Message with the exercises.

I chose Air Squats and Push-Ups as preferred exercises tomoving my butt and building a big chest!

You can of course change the exercises.

Have Fun!
